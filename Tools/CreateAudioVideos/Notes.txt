Using FFmpeg (Recommended)
üîπ Why? FFmpeg is a powerful, cross-platform library for processing video, audio, and other multimedia files.

‚úÖ Pros:

Supports almost all video formats.

Can handle video encoding, merging, filtering, and effects.

Well-documented and widely used.

‚ùå Cons:

Requires bundling FFmpeg with your app or having users install it separately.

Command-line based, so integration is via process execution.

How to Use FFmpeg in WPF
Download FFmpeg: Get the binaries from FFmpeg.org.

Execute FFmpeg Commands in C#:

csharp
Copy
Edit
ProcessStartInfo startInfo = new ProcessStartInfo
{
    FileName = "ffmpeg.exe",
    Arguments = "-framerate 30 -i image%03d.jpg -c:v libx264 output.mp4",
    RedirectStandardOutput = true,
    RedirectStandardError = true,
    UseShellExecute = false,
    CreateNoWindow = true
};
Process process = new Process { StartInfo = startInfo };
process.Start();
For advanced use, you can use libraries like Xabe.FFmpeg to control FFmpeg via C#.

2. Using MediaFoundation (Windows Native)
üîπ Why? Windows has a built-in Media Foundation framework for media processing.

‚úÖ Pros:

No need for third-party dependencies.

Native Windows support with good performance.

‚ùå Cons:

Limited format support (better for MP4, WMV).

API is complex and not well-documented.

Example: Using MediaFoundation to encode a video requires working with IMFSourceReader and IMFSinkWriter.

3. Using DirectShow (Older API)
üîπ Why? DirectShow was Microsoft's go-to multimedia API before Media Foundation.

‚úÖ Pros:

More control over video processing.

Can capture from cameras, apply filters, and render video.

‚ùå Cons:

Outdated API (better alternatives available).

Requires COM interop.

You can use the DirectShow.NET library to simplify integration.

4. Using OpenCV (For Advanced Video Processing)
üîπ Why? OpenCV (via OpenCvSharp) allows image and video manipulation with advanced AI and filters.

‚úÖ Pros:

Can process images, apply filters, and generate videos.

Supports face detection, motion tracking, etc.

‚ùå Cons:

Overkill if you just need simple video generation.

Requires additional dependencies.

Example (Convert Images to Video):

csharp
Copy
Edit
using OpenCvSharp;

var fourcc = VideoWriter.FourCC('M', 'J', 'P', 'G');
using var videoWriter = new VideoWriter("output.avi", fourcc, 30, new Size(640, 480));
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
    using Mat image = Cv2.ImRead($"frame{i}.jpg");
    videoWriter.Write(image);
}
5. Using SkiaSharp (Lightweight for Frame-Based Videos)
üîπ Why? SkiaSharp is a 2D drawing library that can generate frames and combine them into a video.

‚úÖ Pros:

Great for animations and dynamic video creation.

Can generate videos frame by frame.

‚ùå Cons:

Requires an external library (like FFmpeg) to stitch images into a video.
